# K8sman CLI - Complete User Guide

## Introduction

K8sman is a professional-grade command-line interface (CLI) designed for managing Kubernetes clusters securely and efficiently. It eliminates the need for a VPN by routing Kubernetes traffic through a secure proxy, giving you complete control over access to private clusters. K8sman also includes robust auditing and compliance featuresâ€”ensuring that every cluster action is tracked and traceable, making it easier to meet regulatory requirements.

**Key Benefits**  
- **No VPN Required**: Access private clusters through a fully managed proxy layer.  
- **Security & Compliance**: Secure authentication methods, token-based context management, and detailed audit logs to meet compliance standards.  
- **Simplified Cluster Management**: Manage multiple Kubernetes contexts and switch seamlessly between them.  
- **Full Control**: Granular access controls let you define who can access which clusters, along with secure credential storage.

## Key Commands and Features

### 1. Authentication

#### **Login**

Use `k8sman login` to authenticate, store your credentials locally, and ensure secure, compliant access:

```bash
k8sman login
```

When you run this command:
- It opens your default browser.
- Redirects you to the K8sman login page (supports Single Sign-On and other methods).
- Stores a secure token on your machine after successful authentication.

### 2. Context Management

#### **Add a Context**

Add a new Kubernetes context via:

```bash
k8sman context add \
    --token <token> \
    --api-server <api-server-url> \
    [--cluster <cluster-name>]
```

- **--token** (Required): The cluster access token.  
- **--api-server**: The Kubernetes API server URL (uses the proxy server URL if omitted).  
- **--cluster**: An optional custom name for the cluster. If provided, it becomes your active context.

## Example Workflow

1. **Log In to the Platform:**

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

You can customize K8sman using environment variables:

| Variable            | Default Value             | Description                                    |
| ------------------- | ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `PORT`              | `5269`                    | Port for local authentication callbacks        |
| `AUTHENTICATOR_URL` | `https://app.k8sman.io`   | URL for the authenticator service              |
| `PROXY_SERVER_URL`  | `https://proxy.k8sman.io` | URL for the Kubernetes API proxy               |

### Customizing Configuration

Override these defaults by exporting variables or using a `.env` file:
```bash
export PORT=8080
export AUTHENTICATOR_URL=https://custom-auth.url
